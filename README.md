# what's this game?
A player (Bomberman) who has a limited number of bombs, tries to kill a hidden ghost in a maze. The player moves in the maze and places bombs in different places. Once the player put the bomb and decides to make it explode , this latter goes off and the explosion covers a certain surface. If the ghost is in the explosion area, it will be killed and the game is over (the player won). If the ghost is next to the explosion area, the destroyed ground will be red, otherwise it will be green.If a bomb is exploded and the player is nearby, the explosion does not affect him/her and he/she still can across the destroyed area.
If the player has used all the bombs and the ghost has not been killed yet, the game is over and the ghost has survived (the player lost).
